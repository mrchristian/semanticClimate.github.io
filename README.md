# #semanticClimate
There is a pressing need to make knowledge about climate available to mitigate the effects of gaseous emissions. The most important resource is the UNâ€™s IPCC reports, published about every five years. In 2021-2022 AR6, with 10,000 pages, was released. Unfortunatley these are published as a set of PDF files which makes them extremely hard to read by humans or machines, preventing their widespread use. #semanticClimate is a group of young Indian science students who are developing tools and community protocols to make IPCC AR6 semantic.

# Goals
* to convert the IPCC documents from PDF into (a) HTML (b) XML
* extract terms and explore their use and meaning
* link terms to [Wikidata](Wikidata.org) and create AMI-dictionaries
* create new structures for navigation, search, display

# What #SemanticClimate does
We develop tools to liberate knowledge from locked PDFs and host events everybody gets a chance to explore the content in these reports through our tools.
Our [Technical Strategy Page](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/ipcc/ar6/wg3#readme) gives an overview of the tools.
# Upcoming Events
Check out our [Events page](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/events.md) for details about upcoming hackathons we host and other events we are part of.

# How to get involved
We are looking for volunteers/funders to:
- run more events
- develop the code (open an Issue/PR to get started)
- develop the content (start a Discussion thread at https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/)
   - dictionaries
   - semantified chapters
